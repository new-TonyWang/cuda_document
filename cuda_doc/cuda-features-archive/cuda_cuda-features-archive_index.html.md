## 2.2. CUDA Compiler
- For changes to PTX, refer to[https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#ptx-isa-version-8-8](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#ptx-isa-version-8-8).
- Added a new compiler option`--Ofast-compile=<level>`, supported in nvcc, nvlink, nvrtc, and ptxas. This option prioritizes faster compilation over optimizations at varying levels, helping to accelerate development cycles. Refer to the[fast-compile documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-compiler-driver-nvcc/index.html#options-for-altering-compiler-linker-behavior-Ofast-compile)for more details.
- Added a new compiler option`--frandom-seed=<seed>`, supported in nvcc and nvrtc. The user specified random seed will be used to replace random numbers used in generating symbol names and variable names. The option can be used to generate deterministically identical ptx and object files. If the input value is a valid number (decimal, octal, or hex), it will be used directly as the random seed. Otherwise, the CRC value of the passed string will be used instead. NVCC will also pass the option, as well as the user specified value to host compilers, if the host compiler is either GCC or Clang, since they support -frandom-seed option as well. Users are responsible for assigning different seeds to different files.

# 3. CUDA 12.8 Features

## 3.1. General CUDA
- This release adds compiler support for the following Nvidia Blackwell GPU architectures:
  - SM_100
  - SM_101
  - SM_120
- Tegra-Specific:
  - Added MPS support for DRIVE OS QNX
  - Added support for GCC 13.2.0
- Added support for Unified Virtual Memory (UVM) with Extended GPU Memory (EGM) arrays
- Hopper Confidential Computing:
  - Added multi-GPU support for protected PCIe mode
  - Added key rotation capability for single GPU passthrough mode
- NVML Updates:
  - Fixed per-process memory usage reporting for Docker containers using Open GPU Kernel Module drivers
  - Added support for DRAM encryption query and control (Blackwell)
  - Added checkpoint/restore functionality for userspace applications
  - Added support for Blackwell reduced bandwidth mode (RBM)
- CUDA Graphs:
  - Added conditional execution features for CUDA Graphs:
  > - ELSE graph support for IF nodes
  > - SWITCH node support
  - Introduced additional performance optimizations
- CUDA Usermode Driver (UMD):
  - Added PCIe device ID to CUDA device properties
  - Added cudaStreamGetDevice and cuStreamGetDevice APIs to retrieve the device associated with a CUDA stream
  - Added CUDA support for INT101010 texture/surface format
  - Added batch CUDA asynchronous memory copy APIs (cuMemcpyBatchAsync and cuMemcpyBatch3DAsync) for variable-sized transfers between multiple source and destination buffers
- Userspace Checkpoint and Restore:
  - Added new driver API for checkpoint/restore operations

## 3.2. CUDA Compiler
- For changes to PTX, refer to[https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#ptx-isa-version-8-7](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#ptx-isa-version-8-7).
- Added two new nvcc flags:
  - `static-global-template-stub {true|false}`: Controls host side linkage for global/device/constant/managed templates in whole program mode
  - `device-entity-has-hidden-visibility {true|false}`: Controls ELF visibility of global/device/constant/managed symbols
  The current default value for both flags is false. These defaults will change to true in our future release.
  For detailed information about these flags and their impact on existing programs, refer to the`nvcc --help`command or the online CUDA documentation.
- **libNVVM**
  `libNVVM`now supports compilation for the Blackwell family of architectures. Compilation of compute capabilities`compute_100`
  and greater (Blackwell and future architectures) uses an updated NVVM IR dialect, based on LLVM 18.1.8 IR (the “modern” dialect)
  that differs from the older dialect used for pre-Blackwell architectures (a compute capability less than compute_100).
  NVVM IR bitcode using the older dialect generated for pre-Blackwell architectures can be used to target Blackwell and later
  architectures, with the exception of debug metadata.
- **nvdisasm**
  `Nvdisasm`now supports emitting JSON formatted SASS disassembly.

# 4. CUDA 12.6 Features

## 4.1. General CUDA
- The default Linux driver installation changes in this release, preferring NVIDIA GPU Open Kernel Modules to
  proprietary drivers. The open source drivers are now the default and recommended installation option.
  **Important:**The GPU Open Kernel Modules drivers are only compatible with Turing and newer GPUs. If your GPU is from an older family (Maxwell, Pascal, or Volta) you must continue to use the proprietary drivers.
  For additional information, refer to this blog post:[https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-transitions-fully-towards-open-source-gpu-kernel-modules/](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-transitions-fully-towards-open-source-gpu-kernel-modules/).
  And, for full details, the CUDA Installation Guide for Linux:[https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html)
- New`nvidia-open`meta-packages are available to improve driver installation of NVIDIA Open GPU kernel modules. [*4752203*]

## 4.2. CUDA Compiler
- For changes to PTX, refer to[https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#ptx-isa-version-8-5](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#ptx-isa-version-8-5).
- Latest host compiler Clang-18 support.
- Support for Stack Canaries in device code. CUDA compilers can now insert stack canaries in device code. The NVCC flag`--device-stack-protector=true`enables this feature. Stack canaries make it more difficult to exploit certain types of memory safety bugs involving stack-local variables. The compiler uses heuristics to assess the risk of such a bug in each function. Only those functions which are deemed high-risk make use of a stack canary.
- Added a new compiler option`-forward-slash-prefix-opts`(Windows only).
  If this flag is specified, and forwarding unknown options to host toolchain
  is enabled (`-forward-unknown-opts`or`-forward-unknown-to-host-linker`or
  `-forward-unknown-to-host-compiler`), then a command line argument beginning
  with ‘/’ is forwarded to the host toolchain. For example:
  `nvcc -forward-slash-prefix-opts -forward-unknown-opts /T foo.cu`
  will forward the flag`/T`to the host compiler and linker.
  When this flag is not specified, a command line argument beginning with`/`
  is treated as an input file. For example,`nvcc /T foo.cu`will treat`/T`as an input file, and the Windows API function
  `GetFullPathName()`is used to determine the full path name.
  Note: This flag is only supported on Windows.
  For more details, refer to`nvcc-help`.
- An environment variable`NVCC_CCBIN`is introduced for NVCC: Users can set`NVCC_CCBIN`to specify the host compiler, but it has lower priority than command-line option`-ccbin`. If`NVCC_CCBIN`and`-ccbin`are both set, NVCC uses the host compiler specified by`-ccbin`.

# 5. CUDA 12.5 Features

## 5.1. General CUDA
- In an upcoming CUDA release the NVIDIA Open GPU kernel module flavor will be the default and recommended installation option.
  End-users with Maxwell, Pascal, or Volta GPUs may need to take action to install the NVIDIA proprietary kernel modules.
- MPS (Multi-process service) is now supported on L4T and embedded-Linux Tegra platforms. More details can be found[here](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/mps/index.html).

# 6. CUDA 12.4 Features

## 6.1. General CUDA
- Green contexts are a lightweight alternative to traditional contexts, with the ability to pass in a set of resources that they should be initialized with. This allows the developer to represent distinct spatial partitions of the GPU, provision resources for them, and target them via the same programming model that CUDA exposes (streams, kernel launches, etc.). For detail, refer to[https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-driver-api/group__CUDA__GREEN__CONTEXTS.html](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-driver-api/group__CUDA__GREEN__CONTEXTS.html).
- Access-counter-based memory migration for Grace Hopper systems is now enabled by default. As this is the first release with the capability enabled, developers may find that applications that had been optimized for earlier memory migration algorithms may see a performance regression if optimized for the earlier behaviors. Should this occur, we introduce a supported but temporary flag to opt out of this behavior. You can control the enablement of this feature by unloading and reloading the NVIDIA UVM driver, as follows:
  
  ```
  # modprobe -r nvidia_uvm
  
  # modprobe nvidia_uvm uvm_perf_access_counter_mimc_migration_enable=0
  
  ```
- This release introduces support for the following new features in CUDA graphs:
  - Graph conditional nodes (enhanced from 12.3)
  - Device-side node parameter update for device graphs
  - Updatable graph node priorities without recompilation
- Enhanced monitoring capabilities through NVML and nvidia-smi:
  - NVJPG and NVOFA utilization percentage
  - PCIe class and subclass reporting
  - dmon reports are now available in CSV format
  - More descriptive error codes returned from NVML
  - dmon now reports gpm-metrics for MIG (that is,`nvidia-smi dmon --gpm-metrics`runs in MIG mode)
  - NVML running against older drivers will report`FUNCTION_NOT_FOUND`in some cases, failing gracefully if NVML is newer than the driver
  - NVML APIs to query protected memory information for Hopper Confidential Computing
- This release introduces nvFatbin, a new library to create CUDA fat binary files at runtime. For more details, please visit[https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/nvfatbin/index.html](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/nvfatbin/index.html).

## 6.2. CUDA Compilers
- For changes to PTX, refer to[https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#ptx-isa-version-8-4](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#ptx-isa-version-8-4).
- Added the`__maxnreg__`kernel function qualifier to allow users to directly specify the maximum number of registers to be allocated to a single thread in a thread block in CUDA C++.
- Added a new flag`-fdevice-syntax-only`that ends device compilation after front-end syntax checking. This option can provide rapid feedback (warnings and errors) of source code changes as it will not invoke the optimizer. Note: this option will not generate valid object code.
- Add a new flag`-minimal`for NVRTC compilation. The`-minimal`flag omits certain language features to reduce compile time for small programs. In particular, the following are omitted:
  - Texture and surface functions and associated types (for example,`cudaTextureObject_t`).
  - CUDA Runtime Functions that are provided by the cudadevrt device code library, typically named with prefix “cuda”, for example,`cudaMalloc`.
  - Kernel launch from device code.
  - Types and macros associated with CUDA Runtime and Driver APIs, provided by`cuda/tools/cudart/driver_types.h`, typically named with the prefix “cuda” for example,`cudaError_t`.
- Starting in CUDA 12.4, PTXAS enables position independent code (`-pic`) as default when the compilation mode is whole program compilation. Users can opt out by specifying the`-pic=false`option to PTXAS. Debug compilation and separate compilation continue to have position independent code disabled by default. In future, position independent code will allow the CUDA Driver to share a single copy of text section across contexts and reduce resident memory usage.

# 7. CUDA 12.3 Features

## 7.1. General CUDA
- CUDA User Mode Driver, CUDA Runtime libraries and CUBLAS now come with obfuscated symbol names and with frame pointers enabled.
- Frame Pointers are enabled for other libraries in the CUDA Toolkit: NVIDIA Management Library, CUDA Profiling Tools Interface, cuBLAS, Compiler libraries – NVRTC, PTXJIT compiler, nvJitLink, and libnvvm.
  - Allows better runtime visibility and traceability, and allows easier exchange of runtime information with NVIDIA when needed for debugging purposes.
  - See[https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cuda-toolkit-symbol-server/](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cuda-toolkit-symbol-server/)for information on how to use obfuscated symbols.
  - Symbol server address is:[https://cudatoolkit-symbols.nvidia.com/](https://cudatoolkit-symbols.nvidia.com/).
- Lazy loading default enablement for Windows:
  - Brings the significant memory savings and load-time reductions of lazy loading to Windows by default. Additionally, makes the behavior equivalent between Linux and Windows.
- Single-step CUDA uninstall for Windows:
  - It is no longer necessary to uninstall multiple components of the CUDA Toolkit individually to upgrade or uninstall CUDA. This can now be done in a single step.
- CUDA Graphs:
  - Graph edge data, allowing modified dependencies between nodes. Programmatic Dependent Launch may now be described natively in CUDA Graphs.
- Launch completion events:
  - Allows a dependency on scheduling, but not completion, of all blocks in a kernel, enabling tighter control of scheduling.
- MPS:
  - Added a CUDA API to query whether or not MPS is running.
- Added a driver API to return the name of a kernel function.
- Added an API to libnvJitLink to return the nvJitLink version.
- Added support for reading kernel parameters in device functions.
- Enable querying the return type of __device__ lambdas with trailing return type. Fixes uncommon failures when using device-side lambdas.
- NVML / nvidia-smi:
  - Metric for front-end context switch utilization (FECS)
  - Added metrics for Ada Lovelace AV1 codec utilization
  - Support GPU monitoring on Tegra
  - Added an NVML API to expose H100 PCIe counters and corresponding PCIe section in nvidia-smi

## 7.2. CUDA Compilers
- For changes to PTX, refer to[https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#ptx-isa-version-8-3](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#ptx-isa-version-8-3).
- Enhanced thread support when using the libNVVM API. Clients can take advantage of improved compilation speeds by spawning multiple compilation threads concurrently.
- Improved compile time in some common scenarios:
  - Extended split compilation to cubin for LTO.
  - Turned on concurrent NVVM processing by default, with documented fallback to serialized compilation.
  - Reduced NVRTC compile time for small programs via moving CUDA C++ builtin function declarations into compiler.
  - Moved`cuda_fp16.h`and`cuda_bf16.h`into compiler bitcode.
- Added new keyword``__inline_hint__`` to specify device functions in a different`.cu`file to be inlined during LTO.
- Enabled querying return type of __device__ lambdas with trailing return type.
- Provided information about unused bytes to compute-sanitizer for better diagnostics.

# 8. CUDA 12.2 Features

## 8.1. General CUDA
- This release introduces Heterogeneous Memory Management (HMM), allowing seamless sharing of data between host memory and accelerator devices. HMM is supported on Linux only and requires a recent kernel (6.1.24+ or 6.2.11+).
  HMM requires the use of NVIDIA’s GPU Open Kernel Modules driver.
  As this is the first release of HMM, some limitations exist:
  - GPU atomic operations on file-backed memory are not yet supported.
  - Arm CPUs are not yet supported.
  - HugeTLBfs pages are not yet supported on HMM (this is an uncommon scenario).
  - The`fork()`system call is not fully supported yet when attempting to share GPU-accessible memory between parent and child processes.
  - HMM is not yet fully optimized, and may perform slower than programs using`cudaMalloc()`,`cudaMallocManaged()`, or other existing CUDA memory management APIs. The performance of programs not using HMM will not be affected.
- The Lazy Loading feature (introduced in CUDA 11.7) is now enabled by default on Linux with the 535 driver. To disable this feature on Linux, set the environment variable`CUDA_MODULE_LOADING=EAGER`before launch. Default enablement for Windows will happen in a future CUDA driver release. To enable this feature on Windows, set the environment variable`CUDA_MODULE_LOADING=LAZY`before launch.
- Host NUMA memory allocation: Allocate a CPU memory targeting a specific NUMA node using either the CUDA virtual memory management APIs or the CUDA stream-ordered memory allocator. Applications must ensure device accesses to pointer backed by HOST allocations from these APIs are performed only after they have explicitly requested accessibility for the memory on the accessing device. It is undefined behavior to access these host allocations from a device without accessibility for the address range, regardless of whether the device supports pageable memory access or not.
- Added per-client priority mapping at runtime for CUDA Multi-Process Service (MPS). This allows multiple processes running under MPS to arbitrate priority at a coarse-grained level between multiple processes without changing the application code.
  We introduce a new environment variable`CUDA_MPS_CLIENT_PRIORITY`, which accepts two values: NORMAL priority, 0, and BELOW_NORMAL priority, 1.
  For example, given two clients, a potential configuration is as follows:
  
  <div style="overflow-x: auto; max-width: 100%; border-radius: 6px;">
  <table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; margin: 16px 0;">
  <colgroup>
  <col style="width: 50%"/>
  <col style="width: 50%"/>
  </colgroup>
  <tbody>
  <tr style="border: 1px solid #d0d7de;">
  <td style="padding: 8px 12px; border: 1px solid #d0d7de; vertical-align: top;">

  </td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>
  </div>

## 8.2. CUDA Compilers
- libNVVM samples have been moved out of the toolkit and made publicly available on GitHub as part of the NVIDIA/cuda-samples project. Similarly, the nvvmir-samples have been moved from the nvidia-compiler-sdk project on GitHub to the new location of the libNVVM samples in the NVIDIA/cuda-samples project.
- For changes to PTX, refer to[https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#ptx-isa-version-8-2](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#ptx-isa-version-8-2).

- Breakpoint and single stepping behavior for a multi-line statement in device code has been improved, when code is compiled with nvcc using gcc/clang host compiler compiler or when compiled with NVRTC on non-Windows platforms. The debugger will now correctly breakpoint and single-step on each source line of the multiline source code statement.
- PTX has exposed a new special register in the public ISA, which can be used to query total size of shared memory which includes user shared memory and SW reserved shared memory.
- NVCC and NVRTC now show preprocessed source line and column info in a diagnostic to help users to understand the message and identify the issue causing the diagnostic. The source line and column info can be turned off with`--brief-diagnostics=true`.

# 10. CUDA 12.0 Features

## 10.1. General CUDA
- CUDA 12.0 exposes programmable functionality for many features of the Hopper and Ada Lovelace architectures:
  - Many tensor operations now available via public PTX:
    - TMA operations
    - TMA bulk operations
    - 32x Ultra xMMA (including FP8/FP16)
  - Membar domains in Hopper, controlled via launch parameters

  - Genomics/DPX instructions now available for Hopper GPUs to provide faster combined-math arithmetic operations (three-way max, fused add+max, etc.)
- Enhancements to the CUDA graphs API:
  - You can now schedule graph launches from GPU device-side kernels by calling built-in functions. With this ability, user code in kernels can dynamically schedule graph launches, greatly increasing the flexibility of CUDA graphs.
  - The`cudaGraphInstantiate()`API has been refactored to remove unused parameters.
- Added the ability to use virtual memory management (VMM) APIs such as`cuMemCreate()`with GPUs masked by`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.
- Application and library developers can now programmatically update the priority of CUDA streams.
- CUDA 12.0 adds support for revamped CUDA Dynamic Parallelism APIs, offering substantial performance improvements vs. the legacy CUDA Dynamic Parallelism APIs.

  - `cuCtxGetId(CUcontext ctx, unsigned long long *ctxId)`
- Added support for read-only`cuMemSetAccess()`flag`CU_MEM_ACCESS_FLAGS_PROT_READ`.

## 10.2. CUDA Compilers
- JIT LTO support is now officially part of the CUDA Toolkit through a separate nvJitLink library. A technical deep dive blog will go into more details. Note that the earlier implementation of this feature has been deprecated. Refer to the Deprecation/Dropped Features section below for details.
- New host compiler support:
  - GCC 12.1 (Official) and 12.2.1 ( Experimental)
  - VS 2022 17.4 Preview 3 fixes compiler errors mentioning an internal function`std::_Bit_cast`by using CUDA’s support for`__builtin_bit_cast`.
- NVCC and NVRTC now support the c++20 dialect. Most of the language features are available in host and device code; some such as coroutines are not supported in device code. Modules are not supported for both host and device code. Host Compiler Minimum Versions: GCC 10, Clang 11, VS2022, Arm C/C++ 22.x. Refer to the individual Host Compiler documentation for other feature limitations. Note that a compilation issue in C++20 mode with <complex> header mentioning an internal function`std::_Bit_cast`is resolved in VS2022 17.4.
- NVRTC default C++ dialect changed from C++14 to C++17. Refer to the ISO C++ standard for reference on the feature set and compatibility between the dialects.
- NVVM IR Update: with CUDA 12.0 we are releasing NVVM IR 2.0 which is incompatible with NVVM IR 1.x accepted by the libNVVM compiler in prior CUDA toolkit releases. Linking of NVVM IR Version 1.11 with 2.0 will result in a compiler error. Users of the libNVVM compiler in CUDA 12.0 toolkit must generate[NVVM IR 2.0](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/nvvm-ir-spec/index.html).

# 11. CUDA 11.8 Features

## 11.1. General CUDA
> - This release introduces support for both the Hopper and Ada Lovelace GPU families.
> - Added support for Rocky Linux 9.
> - Added support for Kylin OS.
> - Package upgradable CUDA is now available starting CUDA 11.8 for Jetson devices. Refer to[https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-for-tegra-appnote/index.html#upgradable-package-for-jetson](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-for-tegra-appnote/index.html#upgradable-package-for-jetson)for details on how to upgrade to the latest CUDA version on Jetson and the supported JetPack versions.

# 12. CUDA 11.7 Features

## 12.1. General CUDA
- To best ensure the security and reliability of our RPM and Debian package repositories, NVIDIA is updating and rotating the signing keys used by apt, dnf/yum, and zypper package managers beginning April 27, 2022. Failure to update your repository signing keys will result in package management errors when attempting to access or install packages from CUDA repositories. To ensure continued access to the latest NVIDIA software, please follow the instructions here:[https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/updating-the-cuda-linux-gpg-repository-key/](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/updating-the-cuda-linux-gpg-repository-key/).
- NVIDIA Open GPU Kernel Modules: With CUDA 11.7 and R515 driver, NVIDIA is open sourcing the GPU kernel mode driver under dual GPL/MIT license. Refer to[https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#open-gpu-kernel-modules](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#open-gpu-kernel-modules)for more information.
- Lazy Loading: Delay kernel loading from host to GPU to the point where the kernel is called. This also only loads used kernels, which may result in a significant device-side memory savings. This also defers load latency from the beginning of the application to the point where a kernel is first called—overall binary load latency is usually significantly reduced, but is also shifted to later points in the application. To enable this feature, set the environment variable CUDA_MODULE_LOADING=LAZY before launching your process. Note that this feature is only compatible with libraries compiled with CUDA versions >= 11.7.

## 12.2. CUDA Compilers
- Grid private constants
- NVCC host compiler support for clang13

# 13. CUDA 11.6 Features

## 13.1. Compiler
- VS2022 Support: CUDA 11.6 officially supports the latest VS2022 as host compiler. A separate Nsight Visual Studio installer 2022.1.1 must be downloaded from[here](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-visual-studio-edition). A future CUDA release will have the Nsight Visual Studio installer with VS2022 support integrated into it.
- New instructions in public PTX: New instructions for bit mask creation—BMSK, and sign extension—SZEXT, are added to the public PTX ISA. You can find documentation for these instructions in the PTX ISA guide:[BMSK](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#integer-arithmetic-instructions-bmsk)and[SZEXT](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#integer-arithmetic-instructions-szext).
- Unused Kernel Optimization: In CUDA 11.5, unused kernel pruning was introduced with the potential benefits of reducing binary size and improving performance through more efficient optimizations. This was an opt-in feature but in 11.6, this feature is enabled by default. As mentioned in the 11.5 blog, there is an opt-out flag that can be used in case it becomes necessary for debug purposes or for other special situations.
> ```
> $ nvcc -rdc=true user.cu testlib.a -o user -Xnvlink -ignore-host-info
>

- New -arch=native option: In addition to the`-arch=all`and`-arch=all-major`options added in CUDA 11.5, NVCC introduced`-arch= native`in CUDA 11.5 update 1. This -arch=native option is a convenient way for users to let NVCC determine the right target architecture to compile the CUDA device code to based on the GPU installed on the system. This can be particularly helpful for testing when applications are run on the same system they are compiled in.
- Generate PTX from nvlink: Using the following command line, device linker, nvlink will produce PTX as an output in addition to CUBIN:
> ```
> nvcc -dlto -dlink -ptx
> 
> ```
- Device linking by nvlink is the final stage in the CUDA compilation process. Applications that have multiple source translation units have to be compiled in separate compilation mode. LTO (introduced in CUDA 11.4) allowed nvlink to perform optimizations at device link time instead of at compile time so that separately compiled applications with several translation units can be optimized to the same level as whole program compilations with a single translation unit. However, without the option to output PTX, applications that cared about forward compatibility of device code could not benefit from Link Time Optimization or had to constrain the device code to a single source file.
- With the option for nvlink that performs LTO to generate the output in PTX, customer applications that require forward compatibility across GPU architectures can span across multiple files and can also take advantage of Link Time Optimization.
- Bullseye support: NVCC compiled source code now works with the code coverage tool Bullseye. The code coverage is only for the CPU or the host functions. Code coverage for device function is not supported through bullseye.
- INT128 developer tool support: In 11.5, CUDA C++ support for 128 bit was added. In 11.6, developer tools support the datatype as well. With the latest version of libcu++, int 128 data datype is supported by math functions.
